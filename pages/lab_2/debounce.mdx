## Implementing debounce logic for switch inputs

In this lab, students will learn about the concept of debounce logic and its significance in digital systems. They will study Schmitt trigger inputs, which introduce hysteresis to the input signal, improving noise immunity and acting as a switch debouncer. Students will understand how Schmitt triggers help stabilize switch inputs by ensuring that a stable output is produced even in the presence of noisy or bouncing signals.

### Lab Objectives:
- Understand the importance of debounce logic in digital systems and implement debounce logic for switch inputs using Verilog HDL.
-  Learn about Schmitt trigger inputs and their role in improving noise immunity and switch debouncing in digital systems.

### Verilog HDL code
```
module SwitchInputs (
    input wire clk,               // Clock input
    input wire rst,               // Reset input
    input wire single_switch,     // Single switch input
    output reg led_r0            // LEDR0 output
);

// Parameter to adjust debounce delay (in clock cycles)
parameter DELAY = 10;  // Adjust as needed

// Internal debounced switch signals
reg debounced_switch;

// Debounce process for switch inputs
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        // Reset debounced switch state
        debounced_switch <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        // Apply Schmitt trigger input for the single switch
        if (single_switch != debounced_switch) begin
            // If the current switch state is different from the debounced state,
            // wait for the debounce delay before updating the debounced state
            #DELAY;
            debounced_switch <= single_switch;
        end
    end
end

// LED control based on debounced switch input
always @* begin
    // If the switch is pressed (debounced), light up LEDR0
    if (debounced_switch)
        led_r0 = 1'b1;
    else
        led_r0 = 1'b0;
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module implements switch debounce logic and controls an LED output based on the debounced state of a single switch input. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The module is named SwitchInputs and has inputs for clock (clk), reset (rst), and a single switch (single_switch) as well as an output for controlling an LED (led_r0).

2. Debounce Delay Parameter: The DELAY parameter is used to adjust the debounce delay in clock cycles.

3. Internal Signals: The module declares an internal signal debounced_switch to store the debounced state of the single switch input.

4. Debounce Process: An always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the reset signal. Within this block, debounce logic is applied to the single switch input.

5. Debounce Logic: If the switch state changes, the module waits for the debounce delay before updating the debounced state. This helps filter out noise or bouncing signals from the switch.

6. LED Control: Another always block continuously monitors the debounced switch state and controls the LED output (led_r0) accordingly. If the switch is pressed (debounced), the LED is turned on; otherwise, it is turned off.

Overall, this module ensures reliable operation by stabilizing the switch input and providing consistent LED output based on the debounced switch state.
